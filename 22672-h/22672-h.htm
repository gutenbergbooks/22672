<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

<p>There is much satisfaction in the
German Army at the announcement
that iron coins to the value of ten
million marks are to be substituted for
nickel and copper. It is now hoped
that those Crosses may yet prove to be
worth something.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A resident of Honor Oak writes to
the papers to say that such was the
patriotic anxiety of people in his
neighbourhood to pay their taxes at
the earliest possible moment that he
found a long queue before the collector's
door on January 3rd and had to wait
an hour before his turn came. On
reading his letter several West-end
theatres patriotically offered the collector
the loan of their "House Full"
boards.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Prince <span class="sc">William of Wied</span>, the ex-ruler
of Albania, is at present in Serbia,
feverishly awaiting restoration to his
former dignity. The situation is not
very favourable, however, and his
German advisers have warned him to
curb his Mpretuosity.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>An American barque with a cargo of
beans for Germany has been seized and
unloaded by the Swedish authorities.
A cruel fate seems to overtake every
effort of the United States to give
Germany these necessary commodities.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Among the suspicious articles discovered
at the Bulgarian Consulate in
Salonika was a large stock of red
brassards. But the inference that they
belonged to members of the British
V.T.C., who were determined to fight
for the enemy rather than not fight at
all, is certainly premature.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Several inmates of the Swansea
workhouse, having been told that
margarine was to be served out instead
of butter, returned their portions, only
to discover that it was butter after all.
As similar incidents have occurred in
many other establishments it is suggested
that margarine should in future
be dyed scarlet or blue in order to
prevent a repetition of these embarrassing
contretemps.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Sir <span class="sc">John Simon</span>, in the debate on the
Compulsion Bill, said that the alleged
650,000 slackers were arrived at "by
subtracting two figures from one
another." Everyone must agree with
him that if that was the method employed
the result would be "negligible."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>In a tram-car in a Northern city, as
the girl-conductor went round for fares,
a "nut" tried to take a rise out of her
by asking for a ticket to "Gallipoli."
She charged him for the full length of
the tram journey, and as soon as the
tram arrived at a recruiting office she
rang the bell and said, "You change
here, Sir, for Gallipoli."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The <span class="sc">Kaiser</span> thinks it very mean of
the British Government to turn his
Corfu palace into a hospital. His submarine
commanders are now wondering
how to shell the inmates without
damaging their master's property.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The Militant Suffragette who some
years ago damaged the Velasquez
Venus with an axe has just published
a novel, of which the hero is a plumber
who thought he was a poet. It ought to
be called "The Burst Pipe," but isn't.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Women are now employed on some
of the railways in the North. A
traveller recently had two Tommies for
fellow-passengers. They related that
they had every week to take a long
slow duty journey which was "the
limit"; but lately it had taken on
a different aspect, for "<i>now</i>," said
Tommy, "when you get too bored you
just hop out and kiss the porter."</p>

<p>Extract from a letter written to a
loved one from the Front:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"I received your dear little note in a sandbag.
You say that you hope the sandbag stops
a bullet. Well, to tell the truth, I hope it
don't, as I have been patching my trousers
with it."

<p><span class="sc">Prince von Buelow</span>, who has been
for some time in Switzerland, has
obtained an increase in the number of
his secretaries, of whom he now has a
round dozen. Several of the poor
fellows are suffering from writer's
cramp through having to pen so many
letters explaining that the Prince is at
Lucerne purely for the sake of his
health.</p>

<h2>WORLD WARFARE OF THE BRITISH FLEET.</h2>

<blockquote class="note"><span class="sc">What it has done in 1915.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote class="note">(<i>With acknowledgments to Mr. <span class="sc">Archibald Hurd</span> in "The
Daily Telegraph.</i>")</blockquote>

<p>Superiority, and again Superiority! In this one word
lies the secret of our success at sea. Yet it would be hard
to say how many careless civilians there are, taking all
things for granted, who fail to recognise that fact even
now. Not numbers nor organisation, nor men nor guns
nor ships&mdash;though these have counted for something&mdash;have
been responsible for our victory. It has been due
above all to superiority&mdash;sheer superiority.</p>

<p>Think what would have happened if there had been any
strategic fumbling at the opening of the War! It is not
pleasant to reflect upon what might have occurred (had
not superiority stepped in) at the very outset if, for instance,
we had sent several <i>Dreadnoughts</i> to catch the
<i>Emden</i>. It was strongly suspected, mind you, that there
were German armed vessels on the trade routes. As one
merchantman after another was sunk there could no longer
be any doubt about it. What if, in panic, we had suddenly
dispersed our naval force to every part of the globe?
What then? But we didn't. What again if it had been
determined, in accordance with some fanciful scheme, to
concentrate our main striking force in the Mersey?
Germany well might have captured the initiative. But
authority was not distracted from its primary purpose.
Was its policy a success? Come, now, was it?</p>

<p>The old year has gone. On January 4th the British
Fleet had been at war seventeen months&mdash;roughly seventy-four
weeks (anyone can count them up; there is nothing
abstruse about my statistics). In a word, it might almost
be said, with some approach to accuracy, that it has been in
the throes of the struggle for a year and a half. Very well.</p>

<p>The German Flag has been banished from the ocean.
Not since the War began has a German battleship steamed
down the Channel&mdash;nor a battle cruiser, nor yet an
armoured cruiser, nor even a light cruiser, nor a monitor,
nor a destroyer. None of them&mdash;not one. Why is that?
Because (<i>vide supra</i>) the German Fleet has been banished
from the ocean. It still exists, but it is safely locked up
behind explosive agents (mines) and protected by submersive
factors (submarines). The German Fleet is in a zareba.</p>

<p>Let us recall the striking words of one of Germany's
leading naval strategists, written, mark you, before the
War: "England's strength is mainly in her Fleet." I
wonder now if that is generally known.</p>

<p>He goes on to define the duties of a fleet in the following
words:&mdash;</p>

<ol>
<li> To avert invasion.</li>
<li> To keep the sea open for the arrival of imports;</li>
<li> And the departure of exports;</li>
<li> And for the exit of re-exports;</li>
<li> Also the entrance of re-imports.</li>
<li> To protect trade.</li>
</ol>

<p>Has the British Fleet succeeded?</p>

<p>The German Flag is banished from the seas. In January
1916 the German Fleet is still lurking in that zareba.
The <i>Dreadnought</i> embodied an offensive <i>in excelsis</i>, even
as the expansion of the <i>Dreadnought</i> policy embodies an
offensive <i>in extenso</i> and imposes upon the enemy a defensive
<i>in extremis</i>.</p>

<p>It is perhaps hardly realised that the performance of the
British Navy in this War has no parallel in history. In
the past, enemy frigates always succeeded in getting out
of ports, however close the blockade. But none has broken
through this time&mdash;not a single frigate. On the other
hand enemy submarines may be said to have been more
formidable than in the Napoleonic wars.</p>

<p>But the German Fleet is strong. I am not one of the
sort of humourists who hold it up to contempt in its inactivity.
For that matter I am not any sort of humourist.
Perhaps you have found that out. But the German High
Seas Fleet is no fit subject for joke. That it has proved
harmless is due to one thing alone&mdash;superiority.</p>

<p>And so the War wags. All over the high seas our
merchantmen continue to inscribe their indelible furrows.</p>

<p>And where is the German Fleet? I think I have answered
that.</p>

<p>Here then I conclude my synopsis of the work of the
Fleet in 1915. And if it be said that it might well have
stood almost word for word as the record of the work of the
Fleet in 1914, I may reply that I sometimes wistfully
wonder if I shall have to make any alterations in the text
before it goes to press again this time next year.</p>

<h2>THE PESSIPHONE.</h2>

<p>It is weary work being a pessimist
these days, for the process of corrugating
the brow and groaning at the War
news must of necessity entail much
energy. For some time past it has
been patent to sympathetic observers
that what the pessimist to-day really
needs is a machine to do the work for
him.</p>

<p>To meet this want the Electrophobia
Syndicate have invented the Pessiphone&mdash;a
mixture of gramophone
and pessimist&mdash;believing that he who
to-day can make two whimpers grow
where one grew before deserves well of
his country in war time. With the Pessiphone
there is now absolutely no excuse
for cheerfulness. It is the marvel of
the age, and has very fittingly been
described as worth a guinea a groan.
With one pint of petrol the Pessiphone
will disseminate more depression
throughout the household in ten
minutes than could be accomplished
in a day by thirty human pessimists.</p>

<p>As soon as people commence to be
cheerful all you have to do is to press
the button and hold on to something.
A child can start it but nobody can
stop it. Ten minutes is all that is
sufficient to give a whole family melancholia
or creeping dyspepsia. It has
been known to be fatal at 200 yards'
range. Messrs. <span class="sc">Wilkie Bard</span> and
<i>George Graves</i> have already offered a
heavy reward for the body dead or alive
of the inventor&mdash;a fact which speaks
highly for the machine and its maker.</p>

<p>When the instrument was first tried
on a select party of confirmed optimists
two of them rushed out of the
office and have not been heard of since,
while the others clawed savagely at
the office mat.</p>

<p>No burglar will go near it. It will
drive away rate-collectors and poor
relations. One client has already used
it on his mother-in-law with favourable
results.</p>

<p>The Pessiphone is fitted with a little
oil-bath, all black fittings, self-starting
lever, Stormy Arthur two-speed
gear, thus rendering it easy of change
from "Mildly Miserable" to "Devastating,"
and the whole is packed complete
with accessories and delivered
carriage free to your back garden,
where it may be let loose.</p>

<p>The following letters from grateful
pessimists&mdash;all involuntary contributions&mdash;speak
for themselves:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
<span class="sc">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;For years I have been
troubled with ginger hair, but since
using the Pessiphone I have had the
beastly stuff turn grey.
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>
<span class="sc">Dear Sirs</span>,&mdash;I used to read <i>The
Moaning Herald</i> aloud each morning,
but I now use the Pessiphone with
more deadly effect.
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>
<span class="sc">Householder</span> writes: Please turn
the Pessiphone off at the main. None
of my family has been able to get near
the house for five days.
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>
<span class="sc">Golder's Green</span> says: The other
day the butcher's boy, cheerful as
usual, was coming up the garden path
whistling, and though it may hardly
seem credible this so affected the Pessiphone
that it actually jumped off the
table and bit the boy.

<h2>RULES FOR HERO-NAILERS.</h2>

<p>The following notice appears daily
in the <i>Wilhelmshavener Tageblatt.</i></p>

<p>The statue to which it refers, known
as "The Trusty Look-Out," represents
a seaman in oilskins looking out over
the North Sea. The face is that of
<span class="sc">von Tirpitz.</span></p>

<blockquote><p>
The Trusty Look-out.</p>

<p>Nails may be driven into the statue on
week-days between 11 and 1, and on Sundays
between 10 and 5. The sale of tickets for
Nails and Shields takes place at the Treasury
of the Town Hall during office hours, and
also at the time for driving in Nails on
the spot.</p>

<p>Further, tickets for iron Nails may be
bought in the following shops: (<i>here follows
a list of three booksellers, one general store and
six tobacco shops</i>).</p>

<p>The prices are fixed at:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>0.50 m. for an iron Nail.</p>
<p>5.00 m. for a silver Nail.</p>
<p>10.00 m. for a small gold Nail.</p>
<p>20.00 m. for a larger gold Nail.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Anyone who buys 100, 200, 300
or 400 marks' worth of iron Nails
receives a silver Shield with a corresponding
inscription; similarly,
a gold Shield for iron Nails to the
value of 500 and more marks.
<span class="sc">Whoever changes a 10 mark gold
piece receives an iron Nail
free.</span></p>

<p>For the purpose of preparing
inscriptions on Shields the date on
which it is proposed to drive in
the Nails must be notified at the
Treasury three days in advance.</p>

<p>If clubs, societies, or other collections
of people wish to drive in
their Nails in private parties they
are requested to get into touch
with the Municipal Architect, Mr.
Zopff, with a view to fixing the day
and hour, in order that no delay
may be caused by overcrowding.</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p>Not in a spirit of carping criticism,
but as earnest admirers of German
forethought and thoroughness (<i>Gr&uuml;ndlichkeit</i>),
we feel it our duty to point
out that there are a few contingencies
for which these otherwise admirable
regulations fail to provide, and we beg
leave to suggest to the Municipal
Council of Wilhelmshaven the following
additions:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) It is unpatriotic and un-German
to spend more time than necessary
in driving in nails, as standing-room,
the number of hammers and
the patience of the officials are all
limited.</p>

<p>(2) The limit of time allowed for
driving in one nail is one minute, for
a silver nail two minutes, for a small
gold nail two and a-half minutes and
for a large gold nail three minutes.</p>

<p>(3) If in any case the time-limit
is exceeded the Municipal nail-driver
will displace the person whose lack
of skill is responsible for the delay
and will drive home the offending
nail himself.</p>

<p>(4) If any person offers resistance
to this procedure he or she will be
nailed to the statue by the Municipal
nail-driver as a warning to others.
A large <i>iron</i> nail will be used for this
purpose, the charge for which will
be added to the death-duties.</p>

<p>(5) It is unpatriotic and un-German
to use bad language when driving
in nails. However, in view of
the well-known tenderness of the
human heart and the high state of
nervous tension in which many persons
of an ardent patriotic disposition
may be expected to perform this
supreme act of symbolic devotion,
those who drive in iron nails will be
allowed to swear once for each nail,
or seven times for half-a-dozen
nails, whilst a higher proportion of
swear words will be allowed for silver
and gold nails, on the progressive lines
laid down in (2).</p>

<p>(6) Anyone exceeding the patriotic
limit of bad language will be dealt
with by the Municipal nail-driver as
in (4).</p>

<p>(7) Classes of instruction in nail-driving
will be held in the Town-hall
daily between 10 and 11 <span class="sc">A.M.</span> (Sundays
excepted).</p>

<p>(8) Persons who wish to be photographed
in the act of nail-driving
must give notice to the Municipal
photographer two days in advance.
The cost of the photograph will naturally
be in inverse proportion to the
value of the nail which is driven in.</p>

<h2>NIGHT OPERATIONS.</h2>

<p>"Storm or no storm," said Charles,
"as a medical man I can't stick this
fug any longer."</p>

<p>He disappeared behind the heavy
anti-Zepp curtains and opened the window.
A piercing draught caught the
back of Bill's neck and he sat up.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said crossly, "this
is no night for a poor Special to go out
in. Can't I send a medical certificate
instead?"</p>

<p>"You cannot," replied Charles. "I
will not be a party to such evasions."</p>

<p>"It's pouring with rain and blowing
a gale. No Zepp ever hatched would
come over to-night."</p>

<p>"That's not the point, Bill." Kit
unexpectedly opened one eye. "How
are Charles and I to sleep soundly in
our warm beds unless we
know you're outside, guarding
us?"</p>

<p>"That's right," growled Bill.
"Hub it in. Your turn to-morrow,
anyway."</p>

<p>The other two sang the
praises of bed in fervent antistrophe
till at last Bill rose with
a groan and assumed his overcoat,
badge and truncheon. He
stopped at the door.</p>

<p>"Charles," said he, "if after
this night's work I die of
bronchial catarrh, unzepp'd,
unhonoured and unsung&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good night, dear old
thing," interposed Charles
sweetly. "Run away and
play, there's a good child;
Uncle's tired."</p>

<p>He disappeared to bed.</p>

<p>An hour later he was awakened by a
tremendous knocking at the front-door.
Resolutely turning on to his other side,
he tried to ignore it, but the fusillade
continued and swelled. Only when it
appeared likely to do permanent and
irreparable damage to the building did
he rush out on to the landing. There
he met Kit, half awake, with his eyelids
tightly gummed together.</p>

<p>"That ass Bill," he said peevishly.
"Forgotten his latchkey most likely.
Serve him right if we left him there!"</p>

<p>"My good man, one must sleep."</p>

<p>Charles ran downstairs, opened the
door and indignantly confronted the
glistening figure on the steps.</p>

<p>"It is my duty to warn you, Sir,"
said William's voice in an official but
triumphant tone, "that one of your
downstairs windows has been left open.
Most dangerous. Also," he added
quickly, "that I am authorised to use
my truncheon in self-defence, and that
anything you say may be used as
evidence against you."</p>

<h2>UNRULY BRITANNIA.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;I see that Canon
<span class="sc">Masterman</span>, in his Presidential Address
to the Members of the Teachers' Guild
of Great Britain and Ireland, delivered
yesterday week, observed that the German
teacher had been the servant of
the State; his function had been to
foster love for the Fatherland. But,
he continued, "that love was degraded
by jealousy, distrust and arrogance.
The spirit that breathed through our
'Rule, Britannia!' was corrected in our
national life by our sense of humour
and self-criticism." How true and how
necessary! It is indeed surprising to
me that no one has said it before. Why
should we dwell on the greatness of
our sea-power and proclaim our resolve
not to be slaves? I have always understood,
in spite of the view of Sir <span class="sc">Henry
Newbolt</span>, that <span class="sc">Drake</span> was nothing more
than a buccaneer. The public utterance
of such sentiments is surely prejudicial
to "moral uplift," and, in the memorable
words of <i>Mr. Pecksniff</i>, is "Pagan,
I regret to say."</p>

<p>It seems to me that the time has now
come when, in the interests of reticence
and humanity, a serious attempt should
be made to revise our so-called patriotic
songs, and, though fully conscious
of my own literary shortcomings, I
cannot refrain from suggesting, by the
following examples, the lines on which
such revision might be profitably carried
out. For instance, the refrain of
"Rule, Britannia!" would be shorn of
its thrasonical quality and rendered
suitable for use in elementary schools
if it took the following form:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Curb, Britannia, Britannia curb thy pride;</p>
<p>True Britons never, never, never <span class="sc">put on side</span>."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Another song which clamours for
drastic revision is "The British Grenadiers."
I cannot help thinking that it
would be greatly improved if it were
remodelled thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Some talk of <span class="sc">Alexander</span>, and some of <span class="sc">Hercules</span>,</p>
<p>Of <span class="sc">Hector</span> and <span class="sc">Lysander</span>, and warriors such as these;</p>
<p>But infinitely greater than the stroke of any sword</p>
<p>Is the pow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow of <span class="sc">Wilson</span> and of <span class="sc">Ford</span>."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>There are many other standard songs
and poems which could be dealt with
in similar salutary fashion, but I am
content to leave the task to others, and
will content myself with the following
original lines, which, whatever may
be said of their form, have, at any rate,
the root of the matter in them:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"The men who made our Empire great</p>
<p class="i2">Have long ago received their meed;</p>
<p>Then why the tale reiterate?</p>
<p class="i2">Self-criticism now we need.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Then, O my brethren, lest you stumble</p>
<p class="i2">Look carefully before you leap;</p>
<p>Be modest, moderate and 'umble&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">Like the immortal Mr. Heep."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Once more and in conclusion:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Let us be humorous, but never swankful&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">Swank mars the finer fibres of the soul&mdash;</p>
<p>For what we have achieved devoutly thankful,</p>
<p class="i2">But disinclined our prowess to extol;</p>
<p>And, when our foemen bang the drum and bump it,</p>
<p class="i2">In silence be our disapproval shown;</p>
<p>'Tis nobler far to blow another's trumpet</p>
<p class="i2">Than to perform fantasias on your own."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<h2>JOURNALISTIC ENTERPRISE.</h2>

<p>Once upon a time a rash man, wishing
who knows for what?&mdash;possibly
a peerage, possibly to be relieved of
superfluous cash and so no longer have
to pay super-tax, possibly for the mere
joy of pulling wires&mdash;decided to start a
newspaper.</p>

<p>After much consultation the plans
were complete in every particular save
one. The premises were taken, the
staff appointed, the paper, ink and so
forth contracted for, the office girls and
lift girls were engaged, the usual gifted
and briefless barrister was installed
as editor, and the necessary Cabinet
Minister willing to reveal secrets was
obtained. Everything, in short, that a
successful newspaper at the present
time could possibly require was ready,
when it was suddenly remembered that
no provision had been made for a daily
supply of pictures. A popular paper
without pictures being such a crazy
anomaly, a pictorial editor was instantly
advertised for.</p>

<p>"Well," said the editor to the applicant
for the post, "give me an idea of
your originality and resource in the
choice of topical photographs."</p>

<p>"I think you can rely on me to be
original," said the young man, "and
not only original but revolutionary. I
have thought about it all a lot, and I
have made some discoveries. My
notion is that the public wants to be
'in' all that is happening. Nothing's
beneath their notice; their eyes want
food to feast on all the time."</p>

<p>"Go on," said the editor; "you
interest me strangely."</p>

<p>"The function of the camera, as I
conceive it," the young man explained,
"is to serve as the handmaid of the
fountain-pen. Together they are terrific&mdash;a
combination beyond resistance.
That perhaps is the chief of the inspirations
which much pondering
has brought me. One must always be
fortifying the other. People not only
want to read of a thing, they come to
see it, and very rightly. Here is an
example. We are gradually getting
shorter and shorter of messengers, so
much so that many shopkeepers no
longer are able to send purchases home.
That means that people must carry
them themselves. Now what more
interesting, valuable or timely picture
could you have than a photograph of
a customer carrying, say, a loaf of
bread&mdash;a picture of the unfortunate
victim of the <span class="sc">Kaiser</span> in the very act of
having to do something for himself?
How that brings it home to us!"</p>

<p>"By Jove, yes," said the editor,
deeply impressed.</p>

<p>"I could arrange for someone to be
taken just leaving the shop," the applicant
went on; "and I would put underneath
something about the straits to
which the War has brought shoppers."</p>

<p>"Capital!" said the editor. "Go
on."</p>

<p>"Then I have noticed," said the
youth, "that people are interested in
photographs of musical-comedy and
revue actresses."</p>

<p>"I believe you may be right," the
editor remarked pensively.</p>

<p>"So I would arrange for a steady
series of these ladies, which not only
would delight the public but might be
profitable to the advertisement revenue
of the paper if properly managed; for
I should state what plays they were
in, and where."</p>

<p>"A great idea," said the editor.</p>

<p>"But I should not," the young man
continued, "merely give that information
beneath. I should add something
topical, such as 'who has just received
an admiring letter from a stranger at
the Front'; 'who spends her spare time
knitting for our brave lads'; 'whose
latest song is whistled in trench and
camp'; 'who confesses to a great admiration
for Khaki,' and so on. In this
way you get a War interest, and every
one is the better for looking at some
pictures. Nothing is so elevating as
the constant spectacle of young women
with insufficient noses."</p>

<p>"Marvellous!" exclaimed the editor.
"But what of the War itself?"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, I was coming to that,"
the young man went on. "I have a
strong conviction&mdash;I may be wrong,
but I think not&mdash;that war-pictures are
popular, and I have noticed that one
soldier astonishingly resembles another.
This is a priceless discovery, as I will
show. I would therefore get all the
groups of soldiers that I could take in
open country wherever it was most
convenient to my operator, and I would
label them according to recent events.
For example, I would call one group&mdash;and
understand that they would all
have non-committal backgrounds&mdash;'A
wayside chat near Salonica'; another,
'A Tommy narrating the story of his
escape from a Jack Johnson'; a third,
'A hurried lunch somewhere in France';
a fourth, 'How the new group of Lord
<span class="sc">Derby's</span> men will look after a few
weeks'; a fifth, 'Our brave lads leaving
Flanders on short leave'; and so
on."</p>

<p>"But you are a genius!" exclaimed
the editor, surprised into enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"As for the rest of the pictures," said
the applicant, "I have perhaps peculiar
views, but I hold that they ought to be
photographs of Members of Parliament
walking to or from the House of Commons,
a profoundly interesting phase
of modern life too little touched upon;
photographs of the <i>fianc&eacute;es</i> of soldiers,
of whom it does not matter if no
one had ever heard before, engagements
being of the highest importance,
especially at a time when marriage is a
state duty. So much for the staple of
the picture-page, which I trust you do
not consider too daring."</p>

<p>"Daring, perhaps," said the editor,
"but not excessively so, and one must
be both nowadays. One must innovate."</p>

<p>"And then," pursued the youth, "for
padding&mdash;though padding of course
only to the experts, not to the great
hungry asinine public&mdash;anything can
be rendered serviceable provided that
the words beneath are adroit enough.
Thus, a view of Westminster Abbey
would be 'The architectural jewel of
England which the Zeppelins have in
vain tried to bomb'; a view of Victoria
Station, 'The terminus at which every
day and night, thousands of homing
Tommies are welcomed'; any picture
of a dog or cat or canary or parrot
would bear a legend to the effect that
all our brave lads love pets and are
never so happy as when accompanied
by a favourite animal; while any
maritime scene would be certainly
related to a recent submarine outrage,
the Almighty in His infinite wisdom
and prevision having made all expanses
of ocean look alike."</p>

<p>"You are certainly," said the editor,
"a very original and enterprising young
man and I have great pleasure in
engaging you to enrich our sheet."</p>

<p>But when the paper came out the
picture page was found to differ in no
single respect from the other picture
pages in the other dailies.</p>

<h2>A TALE OF HEADS.</h2>

<p>After nine o'clock parade on that
memorable morning the Sergeant-Major
spoke to this effect: Though he, the
Sergeant-Major, was new to the unit,
he could and would make it plain that
It Would Not Do. Had he taken up
his duties in a dashed glee club or in
a blanked choral society, he wanted
to know? Though he had tried hard
not to, he had been forced to admit
that It was d&mdash;&mdash;d disgraceful.  He
had never, he reflected aloud, seen anything
like it during an active army
existence that had provided many
shocking sights. And he opined that
there would be fatigues and C.B.s and
court-martials and shootings-at-dawn
if It continued. He was good, even for
a Sergeant-Major.</p>

<p>The trouble was the hairs of the
heads of the unit. And though he had
rightly got the unit by the hairs which
should have been short we felt it to be
exceeding the limit on his part to refer
to us as blanked musicians. Moreover,
the band were most annoyed
about it.</p>

<p>The Sergeant-Major paused to reflect,
and to arrange matters with what he
imagined was a sense of justice.</p>

<p>Though, he continued bitterly, we
<i>were</i> more like a Spillikins Circle than
an Army unit, he would, from sheer
native kindness of heart, save us the
imminent gibbet or the burial by a
trench-digging party which awaited us.
He would merely illustrate our manifold
faults by taking the case of No. 3
in the rear rank.</p>

<p>"Please, Sir&mdash;&mdash;" This from the
outraged No. 3.</p>

<p>Silence must be observed. There
was no excuse for the state of No. 3's
hair. Here in camp (coldly), though
we <i>were</i> five miles from a town, we
had a barber, and by all report, though
he had been there but two days, an
excellent barber. No. 3, rear rank, did
not appear to know this.</p>

<p>"Sir&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Silence in the ranks. Not only was
the living presence of a most valuable
functionary stultified by No. 3, but he,
like all his slack kind, must babble on
parade. He, the S.-M., would do all
the talking necessary. But even if
No. 3 thought he <i>was</i> back in his local
Debating Society even then he need
not wear his hair long. The others
might look at him to see what an unclipped
man could come to, and afterwards
show him the Barber's Tent.</p>

<p>A ripple went along the ranks, and
No. 3's arms shot up despairingly.</p>

<p>There need be no demonstration, and
No. 3 should remember that he was on
parade and furthermore was standing
at attention. He had had no orders to
practise semaphore signalling.</p>

<p>Well, perhaps (grudgingly) he had
now given the unit some faint inkling
of his feelings on the matter. If at any
time in the future a long hair was found
on a man in his unit, etc., etc. (eleven
minutes).</p>

<p>He would now condescend to hear
any excuse that No. 3, rear rank, had
to offer, so that he would be able to
remark upon its utter worthlessness.
Now, No. 3.</p>

<p>"Please, Sir," viciously, "I'm the
barber."</p>

it. Understood that Cabinet have resolved
to recommend adoption of principle
of compulsory military service.
Rumours abroad of consequent resignations
from Cabinet. To-morrow <span class="sc">Prime
Minister</span> will deal with these matters.
Sufficient for to-day is urgent business
of amending Munitions of War Bill in
order to meet Labour objections.</p>

<p>In such grave circumstances reasonable
to expect that private Members,
howsoever fussy by nature, would restrain
themselves and permit public
business to go forward. Member for
North-West Lanarkshire does not take
that view of his duty. Here is a day
on which eyes of nation are with exceptional
intensity and anxiety fixed on
House of Commons. What an opportunity
for <span class="sc">Pringle</span>-prangling! So at
it he went, kept it up not only, through
Question Hour but, by interruptions of
<span class="sc">Minister of Munitions</span> when speaking
during successive stages of Amending
Bill, by questions in Committee, by
acrimonious speeches on Report Stage
and Third Reading, he hushed <span class="sc">Hogge</span>,
snowed-up <span class="sc">Snowden</span>, ousted <span class="sc">Outhwaite</span>,
and dammed the flow of
<span class="sc">Dalziel's</span> discourse.</p>

<p>In spite of this, which, in addition
to major objections, wasted something
like two hours, work got through a
little before ten o'clock.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Munitions Amendment
Bill, recommitted for insertion of
now clause, passed through remaining
stages. Read a third time amidst
general cheers.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:40%;"><a href="images/033b.png"><img width="100%" src="images/033b.png" alt=""/></a><p>THE PERTINACIOUS PRINGLE</p></div>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;When shortly after
three o'clock this afternoon the <span class="sc">Prime
Minister</span> asked leave to introduce Bill
delicately described as designed "to
make provision with respect to military
service in connection with the present
War" he was greeted by hearty cheer
from audience that packed the Chamber
from floor to topmost row of benches
in Strangers' Gallery. Members who
had not reserved a seat filled the side
Galleries and overflowed in a group
thronging the Bar.</p>

<p>Since the War began we have from
time to time had crowded Houses
awaiting momentous announcement
from <span class="sc">Premier</span>. A distinction of to-day's
gathering is the considerable
proportion of Members in khaki. The
whip summoning attendance had
sounded as far as the trenches in
Flanders, bringing home numbers more
than sufficient to "make a House" of
themselves. Among them was General
<span class="sc">Seely</span>, who contributed to debate one
of its most effective speeches. He met
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg 34]</span>
with friendly reception even from that
part of the House not similarly disposed
when he was accustomed to
address it from Treasury Bench.</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">ex-Home Secretary</span>, rising to
state the conscientious reasons that
compelled the sacrifice of high Ministerial
office, also had warm reception
from all the Benches. General regret
that he will, for the present at least,
resume the status of private Member
after a Ministerial career as brilliant as
it was brief.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Bill requiring military
service for unattested single men
and childless widowers of military
age introduced by <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span>.
Blandly explained that it is not necessarily
compulsory. If this class of
citizen who has hitherto held back
now likes to come forward and enlist
he may do so under the Group system,
which will be reopened for that purpose.
What could be more thoughtful&mdash;or
obliging?</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;By comparison with
yesterday's crowded attendance and
buzzing excitement, through greater
part of to-day's sitting Benches only
moderately full, and general conditions
otherwise normal. Members who objected
to carrying debate over second
day felt themselves justified. Two
speeches made it worth while to extend
debate&mdash;one delivered from below Gangway
by <span class="sc">Long John Ward</span> of Stoke-on-Trent,
now a full-blown Colonel.
Hurried over from the Front to defend
and vote for Compulsion Bill, although
heretofore a strong opponent of conscription.
Animated manly speech,
much cheered from all quarters.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span>, who, moving from
modest place habitually occupied towards
lower end of Treasury Bench,
seated himself next the <span class="sc">Premier</span>,
thence shortly after ten o'clock rose
and delivered a speech which recalled
his greatest triumphs achieved in former
days when in different circumstances
he stood by same historic brass-bound
box which <span class="sc">Dizzy</span> in his day
clutched and <span class="sc">Gladstone</span> thumped.</p>

<p>As he resumed his seat amidst storm
of cheering, <span class="sc">Speaker</span> put the Question
for leave to introduce the Bill. A
mighty shout of "Ay!" responded,
answered by futile cry of "No!"</p>

<p>"Agreed! agreed!" cried the peace-makers.
But the minority were out
for a division and insisted on taking it.
Resulted in leave being given by majority
of four to one, a conclusion hailed
with renewed outburst of cheering.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Leave given by 403
votes against 105. <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span>
brought in Military Service Bill.</p>

<h2>AT THE PLAY.</h2>

<p>"<span class="sc">The Basker</span>."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:30%;"><a href="images/036a.png"><img width="100%" src="images/036a.png" alt=""/></a><p>Miss <span class="sc">Hilda Moore</span> as <i>Mrs. Radford</i>.</p></div>

<p>I imagine <i>The Basker</i> to be designed
by "<span class="sc">Clifford Mills</span>" as a
Tract against Dukes. And certainly
her <i>Duke of Cheviot</i> is a miracle of
obtuseness, who, if he had not been
made a hero by his valet (an original
and happy creation), would have grievously
belied the proud old family motto,
"<i>Je me sauvegarde</i>." <i>George de Lacorfe</i>,
fashionable, <i>fain&eacute;ant</i> and forty, reader
of <i>The Pink 'Un</i>, ardent bachelor,
<i>Basker</i> in short, suddenly finds the
dukedom of Cheviot thrust upon him.
Quite unlike his egregious ancestors,
who went out and biffed their enemies
in the gate, especially the <i>Gorndykes</i>,
who were an unpleasant shifty kind of
raiders, <i>George</i> proposes to resign all
the Cheviot places, emoluments and
responsibilities to his cousin and heir,
<i>Richard de Lacorfe</i>, on the day the
said <i>Richard</i> shall marry. Now <i>Richard</i>
is a <i>de Lacorfe</i> with the hereditary
<i>Gorndyke</i> blood and nose acquired on
the distaff side. This conspicuous organ
inflames the anger of <i>George's</i> grandmother,
the dowager, steeped as she is
in the history and prejudices of the
family, while other members of the
august circle harbour unkind thoughts
about their kinsman.</p>

<p>And well they might. If anyone had
"wrong 'un" written all over him it
was <i>Richard</i>. Indeed his Roman nose
was the straightest part of him.
The guileless <i>George</i> who, though
(or because) his grandmother presented
him every birthday after
his majority with a copy of <i>The
History of the de Lacorfes</i>, knew
and cared nothing about their
glorious and stormy past, didn't
suspect the <i>Gorndyke</i> rat in the
<i>de Lacorfe</i> granary. Spendthrift
<i>Richard</i>, who is always getting
urgent blue envelopes from
<i>Samuel &amp; Samuel</i>, is bent on
marrying for money the very
<i>Diana</i> that <i>George</i> loves for her
blue hyacinth eyes. There is a
misunderstanding between <i>George</i>
and <i>Diana</i> (of such a childlike
ingenuousness as to suggest that
really this too easy spot-stroke
should be barred to playwrights),
and the idiotic girl promptly engages
herself to <i>Richard</i>, who is
of course in love with a patently
naughty married woman. The
most reckless of lovers from the
moment when in his ardour he
(apparently) bites this lady's
hand in the First Act, in full
view of the family, till he plans a
flirtation by the Cheviot
postern gate on the very eve of
his marriage to <i>Diana</i>, he is an obviously
doomed villain. The lady is surprised
by <i>George</i> in the act of knocking
thrice on the said postern within.
When three knocks are heard without
together with the voice of <i>Richard</i>, the
<i>Duke</i> really begins to suspect something.
Virtuous imbecility prevails over
villainous stupidity. The final blow is
dealt upon the <i>Gorndyke</i> nose. <i>Diana</i>
is retrieved by this last of the safe-guarders,
and we are left to a melancholy
calculation as to what the mental
capacity of their issue is likely to be.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:50%;"><a href="images/036b.png"><img width="100%" src="images/036b.png" alt=""/></a><p>THE SOUL'S AWAKENING.</p>
<p><i>Nalet</i>, the valet (Mr. <span class="sc">Leon Quartermaine</span>), having been
dismissed for not calling <i>George de Lacorfe</i> (Sir <span class="sc">George
Alexander</span>) in the morning, makes good by waking his
master's soul up at one o'clock at night.</p></div>

<p>A good deal of spontaneous and
honest laughter, the best of testimonials,
greeted this rather ingenuous
extravaganza. I think Mrs. <span class="sc">Clifford
Mills</span> would do well not to prolong
her mystifications beyond the point
when they are quite clear to her
audience. May I without boastfulness
record that I guessed all about what
<i>Richard</i> was going to do with the tiara
quite three minutes before a well-known
editor in front of me gave away the
secret in a hoarse whisper to his neighbour?
And that was some time before
the author had finished the "preparation"
of the business. And may I ask
why <i>Richard</i> was forced to so fatuous
a contrivance as the pawning of the
tiara to make the exigent <i>Samuels</i> stay
their hands for a week? True he
couldn't tell them about the Cheviot deal,
which was a secret between himself and
<i>George</i>; but he could surely have used
the fact of his coming marriage with
<i>Diana's</i> money? And why didn't
<i>Diana</i> write to her mother and ask her
what was the solemn warning about
<i>Richard</i> that she had on the tip of her
tongue when she was interrupted just
before going abroad? There <i>is</i> a mail
to Singapore, isn't there? And does a
<i>George</i>, succeeding to a dukedom, become
"<i>Cheviot</i>" to his sister?</p>

<p>Sir <span class="sc">George Alexander</span> was at his
excellent best in the lighter moods of
the <i>Basker</i>. But I did not like
to see him in pain (especially as
it all seemed so unnecessary).
Mr. <span class="sc">Leon Quartermaine</span>, in the
really engaging part of the <i>Duke's</i>
valet, who learned to think for
himself and read to such excellent
effect the history so carelessly
neglected by his master, was
quite admirable. But then he
always is. Mr. <span class="sc">Norman Forbes</span>
had little to exercise his powers
in a churchwarden version of the
stage-parson with a tiresome
wife. Miss <span class="sc">Hilda Moore</span> looked
charmingly wicked and acted
with intelligence. The too serious
<i>r&ocirc;le</i> tossed lightly by the author
into the broadest farce presents
an impossible problem. Miss
<span class="sc">Ellen O'Malley</span> never mishandles
a part. Sometimes, as
here, a part is not too kind to her.
As <i>George's</i> sister she could be
no more than a competent peg.
Miss <span class="sc">Marie Hemingway</span> had
merely to look perplexed and
pretty, which she did with complete
success.  Everyone was
frankly delighted to welcome back
to the stage that great artist Miss
<span class="sc">Genevieve Ward</span> as the <i>Dowager Duchess</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg 37]</span>
She had the sort of reception
that is only accorded to favourites of
much more than common merit. And
she played with decision, humour and
resource. Sir <span class="sc">George</span> made a happy
and generous little speech about her.
The author was called to receive the
felicitations of a gratified house.</p>

<h2>MY BIRTHDAY.</h2>

<p>"My birthday," I said, "is setting in with its usual
severity."</p>

<p>"What," said Francesca, "has driven you to this terrible
conclusion?"</p>

<p>"Little signs; straws showing how the wind blows."</p>

<p>"I wonder," she said, "how that came to be a proverb.
Personally I don't keep packets of straws to test the wind
by, and I never met anybody else who did. Handkerchiefs
are much more certain, and men's hats are best of all."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "when I see my hat starting full tilt
on an excursion I always know which way the wind is
blowing right enough. Tell me, Francesca, why does a
man's hat, when it's blown off, always bring up in a
puddle?"</p>

<p>"And get run over by a butcher's cart?"</p>

<p>"And why does everybody laugh at the hat's owner?"</p>

<p>"And why does the boy who brings it back to you
expect payment for the miserable and useless object?"</p>

<p>"And where," I said, "does the owner disappear to
afterwards? You never see a man with a hat on his head
that's been run over&mdash;no, I mean, with a hat that's been
run over on his head&mdash;no, no, I mean, with a hat that's
been run over off his head&mdash;Francesca, I give it up; I shall
never get that sentence right, but you know what I mean.
Anyhow I will put the dreadful vision by. What was I
talking about when this hat calamity broke in?"</p>

<p>"You had made," said Francesca, "a cold and distant
allusion to your birthday. It's coming to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "it can come if it likes, but I shall refuse
to receive it. I don't want it. I'm quite old enough
without it. At my age people don't have birthdays. They
just go on living, and other people say how wonderful they
are for their years, and they must be sixty if they're a day,
but nobody would think so, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And that it's all due to early rising and regular habits."</p>

<p>"And smoking and partial abstemiousness."</p>

<p>"And general good conduct. But you can have all that
sort of praise and yet celebrate your birthday."</p>

<p>"But I tell you I won't have my birthday celebrated.
Those are my orders."</p>

<p>"Orders?" she said. "People don't give orders about
absurdities like that."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "they do; but their orders are not obeyed.
There's Frederick, for instance. He's only eight, I know,
but he's got something up his sleeve. He asked me
yesterday if I could lend him threepence, and did I think
that a small notebook with a pencil would be a nice present
for a sort of uncle on his birthday&mdash;not a father, mind you,
but an uncle. There's a Machiavelli for you."</p>

<p>"And what did you say?"</p>

<p>"I told him I had never met an uncle who didn't adore
notebooks, but that few fathers really appreciated them;
and then he countered me. He said he had noticed that
many fathers were uncles too."</p>

<p>"That child," said Francesca, "will be a Lord Chancellor.
He'd look splendid on a woolsack."</p>

<p>"Yes, later on. At present his legs would dangle a bit,
wouldn't they?"</p>

<p>"They're very-well-shaped legs, anyhow. Any Lord
Chancellor would be proud to possess them."</p>

<p>"To resume," I said, "about the birthday. There's
Alice too. She's engaged on some nefarious scheme with a
paint-box and a sheet of paper. It's directed at me, I
know, because, whenever I approach her, things have to
be hustled away or covered up. However, it's all useless.
My mind's made up. I will <i>not</i> have a birthday."</p>

<p>"You can't prevent it, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes, I can," I said. "It's mine, and if I decide not to
have it nobody can make me."</p>

<p>"But isn't that rather selfish?"</p>

<p>"It can't be selfish of me to deprive myself of a birthday."</p>

<p>"But you're depriving the children of it, and that's
worse than selfish. It's positively heartless."</p>

<p>"Very well, then, I'm heartless. At any rate my orders
are that there shall be no birthday; and don't you forget it,
or, rather, forget it as hard as ever you can."</p>

<p>"I can't hold out the least prospect that your suggestion
will meet with favourable consideration."</p>

<p>The birthday duly arrived, and I went down to breakfast.
As I entered the room a shout of applause broke from the
already assembled family. "Look at your place," said
Frederick. I did, and beheld on the table a collection of
unaccustomed articles. There was a box of chocolates
from Muriel and Nina; there was a note-book with an
appropriate pencil. "That," said Frederick, "is for Cousin
Herbert's uncle. Ha, ha!" And there was, from Alice,
a painted Calendar fit to hang on any wall. It represents
a Tartar nobleman haughtily walking in a green meadow,
with a background of snow-capped mountains. He has a
long pig-tail and a black velvet cap with a puce knob.
His trousers are blue striped with purple. He has a long
blue cloak decorated with red figures, and his carmine
train is borne by a juvenile page dressed in a short orange-coloured
robe. It is a very magnificent design, and on
the back of it is written:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"This is but a Birthday rhyme</p>
<p>Written in this dark War-time.</p>
<p>We can't afford to waste our ink,</p>
<p>And so I'll quickly stop, I think."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Thus I was compelled to have a birthday after all.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Narcissus</i> (<span class="sc">Secker</span>), by Miss <span class="sc">Viola Meynell</span>, is one of
those books for which I cannot help feeling that my appreciation
would have been keener two years ago than is
possible to-day. It is the story of the growth to manhood
of two brothers, <i>Victor</i> and <i>Jimmy</i>, who live with their
widowed mother in an outer suburb of London. That
there is art, very subtle and delicate art, in the telling of it
goes without saying. The characters of the brothers are
realized with exquisite care. <i>Victor</i>, the elder, uncertain,
violently sensitive and emotional, seeking always from life
what he is never destined (at least so far as the present
story carries him) to attain; <i>Jimmy</i>, placid, shallow,
avoiding all emotion, attracting happiness like a magnet.
Nothing, I repeat, could be better done in its kind than
the pictures of these two, and of the not very interesting
crowd of young persons among whom they move. But, for
all its real beauty of style, I have to confess that the book
left me cold, and even a little irritated. Perhaps we demand
something more from our heroes these days than susceptibility,
or indifference, to emotion. Was the purpose of
life, one wonders, ever as delicately elusive as these bewildered
young men seem to find it? I kept longing for
Lord <span class="sc">Derby</span>. Perhaps, again, this is but part of the cleverness
of the writer, and Miss <span class="sc">Meynell</span>, like the child in
the poem, only does it to annoy. But I hardly think so.
Her tenderness and sympathy for <i>Victor</i> especially are
obvious. He, I take it, is <i>Narcissus</i> (though <i>Narcissi</i> would
have been a truer title for the book, as each of the brothers
is more in love with his own reflection than with anything
else), and, since he is left unmarried at the close of the
volume, I derived some quiet satisfaction from the thought
that modified conscription might yet make a man of him.</p>

<hr />

<p>Why will the heroes of historical fiction persist in that
dangerous practice of leaving an angry and overmastered
villain bound to a tree to await death or rescue? The
result is rescue every time, and one way and another a
mort of trouble for the good characters. Still it may be
argued that if the protagonist of <i>The Fortunes of Garin</i>
(<span class="sc">Constable</span>) had not followed this risky precedent those
fortunes would not have led him where they eventually
did, and we should have missed one of the best costume
novels of the year. Miss <span class="sc">Mary Johnston</span> is among the
very few waiters whom I can follow without weariness
through the mazes of medi&aelig;valism.  This tale of the
adventures of a knight and a lady in the days when
<span class="sc">Henry II.</span> sat on the throne of England, and his son
<span class="sc">Richard</span> princed it in Angoul&ecirc;me, is told with an air
that lifts it out of tushery into romance. She wields a
picturesque and courtly style, sometimes indeed a trifle
too charged with metaphor to be altogether manageable
(as for example when she speaks of "pouring oil upon the
red embers of a score unpaid"), but for the most part
admirably pleasing to the ear. Her antique figures are
alive; and the whole tale goes forward with a various and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg 40]</span>
high-stepping movement and a glow of colour that reminded
me of nothing more than that splendid pageant one follows
round the walls of the Riccardi Palace in Florence. Of
course the journey ends in lovers' meeting and the teaching
of his place to the evil-minded. The fact that this latter
was called <i>Jaufre</i>, a name that I would wish kindlier
entreated, is almost my only complaint against a lively
and entertaining story which more than once rises to real
beauty.</p>

<hr />

<p>Given a plot of the conventional order I dare say it is
best to make very little fuss or mystery about it. So, at
any rate, "<span class="sc">Katharine Tynan</span>" seems to think, for after about
page 32 of her latest book, <i>Since First I Saw Your Face</i>
(<span class="sc">Hutchinson</span>), there is really almost no guessing left to do,
the authoress seeming principally concerned to ensure a
smooth passage for one's prophecies. Thus, while the unknown
son of a secret marriage,
happening by good luck to
thrash the ostensible claimant
to the title and heroine, gets
that successful start in the early
pages that is so necessary to
his happiness in the last, and
the lady never really looks like
straying far into disconcerting
opinions of her own, even the
rival himself obliges us by
throwing up the sponge just
when the game should really
begin. All this is soothing
enough, but it is also very thin
stuff; and the addition of a
ghostly ancestress, who lures
her descendants to midnight
assignations by smiling at them
out of a <span class="sc">Lely</span> painting, does
not stiffen things much. The
fact is that away from such a
purely Irish subject as, say,
"Countrymen All," Mrs. <span class="sc">Hinkson</span>
really has not much to tell.
Sweeney's New York Stores do
not harmonise at all well with her
atmosphere of wistful tragedy.
The effect suggests a soap-bubble
trying to cake-walk.</p>

<p>In an eloquent foreword to <i>The Queen's Gift Book</i>,
(<span class="sc">Hodder and Stoughton</span>), we are told by Mr. <span class="sc">Galsworthy</span>
that it is "in the nature of a hat passed round, into which,
God send, many hundred thousand
coins may be poured."
The coin that we are asked to
put into what I hope will be a
very widely circulating hat is
half-a-crown, and whatever you
may or may not think of Gift
Books I can promise you that
in this instance to pay your
money is to get its worth. It
is true that some of the contributors
have given us work that
we have already had an opportunity
to know; but even here
I am not grumbling, for among
the stories that have already
been published is Mr. <span class="sc">Leonard
Merrick's</span> "The Fairy Poodle,"
a tale so full of sparkle that
the oftener I see it the better
I shall be pleased. All tastes,
however, are catered for. You
can read tales by Sir <span class="sc">J. M.
Barrie</span> or Mr. <span class="sc">Joseph Hocking</span>,
verses by Sir <span class="sc">Arthur Conan
Doyle</span>, Mr. <span class="sc">John Oxenham</span> or
Mrs. <span class="sc">Henry de la Pasture</span>,
sketches by Mr. <span class="sc">Conrad</span> or
"<span class="sc">Sapper</span>."  But I advise you to
read the lot. An especial word
of praise is, I feel, due to Mr. <span class="sc">John Buchan</span> for a tale
humorous enough in its dry way to squeeze a smile from a
mummy, and to the artists who have helped to make this
Gift the success that it is. In short, the book is good,
nearly as good as the object for which it has been
published. "In aid," we read on the cover, "of Queen
Mary's Convalescent Auxiliary Hospitals. For Soldiers
and Sailors who have lost their limbs in the War." Here
then, by helping to provide our maimed heroes with the
best mechanical substitutes for the limbs which they have
lost, is a chance for us to pay a little of the unpayable debt
we owe to them. Mr. <span class="sc">Galsworthy</span> may rest assured that
his appeal to "our honour in this matter" will not be
made in vain.</p>
